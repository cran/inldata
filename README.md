Description
-----------

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package **inldata** is a collection
of datasets for the U.S. Geological Survey-Idaho National Laboratory
aquifer monitoring networks administrated by the [Idaho National
Laboratory Project
Office](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/id-water/science/idaho-national-laboratory-project-office)
in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. Data collected from
wells at the Idaho National Laboratory have been used to describe the
effects of waste disposal on water contained in the eastern Snake River
Plain aquifer, located in the southeastern part of Idaho, and the
availability of water for long-term consumptive and industrial use.
Included in this package are the long-term monitoring records, dating
back to measurements from 1949, and the geospatial data describing the
areas from which samples were collected or observations were made.
Bundling this data into a single R package significantly reduces the
magnitude of data processing for researches. And provides a way to
distribute the data along with its documentation in a standard format.
Geospatial datasets are made available in a common projection and datum,
and geohydrologic data have been structured to facilitate analysis. A
list of all datasets in the package is given below.

Installation
------------

The current release is available on
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=inldata "The Comprehensive R Archive Network"),
which you can install using the following command:

``` r
install.packages("inldata")
```

To also install user-contributed packages that **inldata** depends on to
(1) run examples in the package help documentation, and (2) run code
used to build package datasets, run:

``` r
install.packages("inldata", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To install the development version, you need to clone the repository and
build from source, or run:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("inl/inldata", host = "code.usgs.gov",
                        dependencies = TRUE)
```

Usage
-----

Examples are given in the package help pages. To access this
documentation, run:

Description
-----------

The **inldata** package is a collection of analysis-ready datasets for
the U.S. Geological Survey - Idaho National Laboratory (USGS-INL)
groundwater and surface-water monitoring networks, administered by the
[USGS-INL Project
Office](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/idaho-water-science-center/science/idaho-national-laboratory-project-office)
in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy. The data collected
from wells and surface-water stations at the Idaho National Laboratory
and surrounding areas have been used to describe the effects of waste
disposal on water contained in the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer,
located in the southeastern part of Idaho, and the availability of water
for long-term consumptive and industrial use. The package includes
long-term monitoring records dating back to measurements from 1922.
Geospatial data describing the areas from which samples were collected
or observations were made are also included in the package. Bundling
this data into a single [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package
significantly reduces the magnitude of data processing for researchers
and provides a way to distribute the data along with its documentation
in a standard format. Geospatial datasets are made available in a common
projection and datum, and geohydrologic data have been structured to
facilitate analysis.

Installation
------------

To install the current release of the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=inldata), you can use the
following command in R:

``` r
install.packages("inldata")
```

To install the package along with its dependencies, which are required
to run examples in the package help documentation, build package
datasets, and create a USGS data release, run:

``` r
install.packages("inldata", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To install the development version of the package, you need to clone the
repository and build from source, or run the following commands:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("inl/inldata@develop",
  auth_token = Sys.getenv("GITLAB_PAT"),
  host = "code.usgs.gov",
  dependencies = TRUE,
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

Usage
-----

Detailed descriptions of the datasets, along with practical examples
illustrating their application, are readily accessible in the help pages
of the package. To access this documentation, simply run the following
command:

``` r
library("inldata")
help(package = "inldata")
```

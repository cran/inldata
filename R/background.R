#' Background Concentrations
#'
#' @description Water-quality background concentrations for selected radionuclides, organic compounds,
#'   and chemical constituents that were analyzed for in water from the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer
#'   at and near the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).
#'   The background concentrations are defined as groundwater influenced by western tributary recharge
#'   in the western INL and by eastern regional recharge in the eastern INL.
#'   These concentrations are either naturally occurring or anthropogenic
#'   (substances present in the environment as a result of human activities)
#'   and are not influenced by waste and wastewater disposal at the INL,
#'   according to Bartholomay and Hall (2016).

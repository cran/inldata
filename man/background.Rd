\description{
Water-quality background concentrations for selected radionuclides, organic compounds,
and chemical constituents that were analyzed for in water from the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer
at and near the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).
The background concentrations are defined as groundwater influenced by western tributary recharge
in the western INL and by eastern regional recharge in the eastern INL.
These concentrations are either naturally occurring or anthropogenic
(substances present in the environment as a result of human activities)
and are not influenced by waste and wastewater disposal at the INL,
according to Bartholomay and Hall (2016).

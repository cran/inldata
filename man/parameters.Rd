\title{Parameter Information}
\format{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{pcode}}{USGS 5-digit parameter code.}
\item{\code{parm_group_nm}}{Parameter group name.
Abbreviations and descriptions are as follows:
"Information" includes information about the water sample such as
the date and time of collection, the location of the sample, and the method of analysis used;
"Inorganics, Major, Metals" includes major inorganic ions and metals,
"Inorganics, Major, Non-metals" includes major inorganic non-metallic ions;
"Inorganics, Minor, Metals" includes minor inorganic metallic ions;
"Inorganics, Minor, Non-metals" includes minor inorganic non-metallic ions;
"Nutrient" includes nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that can be present in water samples;
"Organics, Other" includes organic compounds that are not classified as pesticides or PCBs;
"Organics, Pesticide" includes organic compounds that are used as pesticides,
such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides;
"Physical" includes physical characteristics of water;
"Radiochemical" includes radioactive isotopes that can be present in water samples; and
"Stable Isotopes" includes non-radioactive isotopes of elements that can be
used to trace the movement of water through the hydrologic cycle.}
\item{\code{parm_nm}}{Long parameter name,
such as "Strontium-90, water, unfiltered, picocuries per liter".}
\item{\code{casrn}}{Chemical Abstracts Service
(\href{https://www.cas.org/support/documentation/chemical-substances/faqs}{CAS}) registry number,
such as "10098-97-2" for Strontium-90.}
\item{\code{srsname}}{Substance Registry Services
(\href{https://sor.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/substreg/home/overview/home.do}{SRS}) name,
such as "Strontium-90".}
\item{\code{parm_unit}}{Parameter units of measure, see \code{\link{units}} dataset for unit descriptions.}
\item{\code{min_dt}}{Collection date of first sample analyzed for the parameter.}
\item{\code{max_dt}}{Collection date of last sample analyzed for the parameter.}
\item{\code{nrecords}}{Number of records associated with the parameter.}
\item{\code{nsites}}{Number of sampling sites where the parameter was observed.}
